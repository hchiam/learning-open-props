# Learning template [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-template/blob/main/LICENSE)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

(To use this template fast with [`gh` CLI](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-gh), you can run [`gh repo create --template learning-template learning-...`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create))

(To create a convenience script repo, use this template instead: https://github.com/hchiam/convenience)

(To create a website fast, use a code generator like [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-nextjs), [`sapper`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-sapper), a [svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template), or [`yo`](https://yeoman.io/generators) )
